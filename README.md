### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Temoso Phokane

**What keeps me curious?**

* Currently diving deep into the world of Java and SQL.
* "The best way to predict the future is to invent it." - Alan Kay

**Keep it fun!**

* Coding can be challenging, but it's also a ton of fun!  Every bug fixed, every new skill learned, every completed line of code is a victory! I take the time to acknowledge my progress, no matter how small. This keeps me motivated and reminds me of how far I've come.

**Let's grow together!**

I'm always looking to connect with other programmers, especially beginners like me. Feel free to reach out and say hi!
